[The Rockstor Project](https://opencollective.com/the-rockstor-project)
is an [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) Non-Profit/Non-Business Open Source community endeavour.

We are supported by our members/subscribers/contributors and fiscally hosted by [Open Collective Europe](https://opencollective.com/europe).

*Founder & prior Maintainer: Suman Chakravartula - Domain and [trademarks]({{< ref legal.md >}}) owner/admin.*

*Current Maintainer: Philip Paul Guyton - Project lead, core developer, & release manager.*

Our website uses the "rockstor" domain, while support uses the "linuxlines" domain.
We hope to further rationalise these 'mixed' domains as we work towards sustainable Open Source development.

## Our Endeavour
---
To develop, maintain, and distribute an easy to use, flexible, Linux & BTRFS based DIY software appliance solution.

**Open source and community focused.** We develop on GitHub in collaboration with our users,

our community, and anyone who wants to help.

**Docker based Rock-on Extensibility.** Easy to roll your own and then contribute it back to the community.

**Simplicity & Usability.** Simple clear and intuitive user interface for what most folks do, most of the time.

**DIY Personal storage.** Provides 'private cloud' storage to all your networked devices.

Privacy, security, and freedom.

**Simple Storage done Sustainably.**
